# Dawn Quizote: Submission for Epyphite Corp Take Home Assignment

Dawn Quizote is a parkour enthusiast and Pop Quiz aficionado. Help her get good at both in this gamified quiz app that combines subway surfer with a traditional quiz app like QuizUp or Kahoot!

## Design Justification

The reason for the use of subway surfer gameplay is to use the 3D aspect of Unity in a way that increases user engagement, even though 3D is not strictly required for a quiz app. The dynamic movement in the background and the idea of doing parkour while answering questions adds to a sense of urgency which is helpful for quizzes that are timed.

## Gameplay

The correct answer to each question must be provided within a specified time limit, for the runner to cross the obstacle with finesse (parkour style). Each correct answer will add to a total score, with quicker answers being rewarded with more points. Otherwise, they will collide with the obstacle and suffer a reduction in their total score. This running sequence will continue until the player has finished the quiz.
